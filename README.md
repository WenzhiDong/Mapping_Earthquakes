# Mapping_Earthquakes

## Basic Project Plan
### Purpose
The purpose of this project is to visually show the differences between the magnitudes of earthquakes all over the world for the last seven days.

### Tasks
To complete this project, use a URL for GeoJSON earthquake data from the USGS website and retrieve geographical coordinates and the magnitudes of earthquakes for the last seven days. Then add the data to a map.

### Approach
I will use the JavaScript and the D3.js library to retrieve the coordinates and magnitudes of the earthquakes from the GeoJSON data. 
I will use the Leaflet library to plot the data on a Mapbox map through an API request and create interactivity for the earthquake data.

## Layers
 - Three tile layers: "dark", "satellite" and "street"
 - Three Overlays: 'AllEarthquakes', "TectonicPlates", "Major Earthquake"
By changing tile layers, you can choose different styles of the map.
By changing overlays: you can choose to hide unwanted data.
